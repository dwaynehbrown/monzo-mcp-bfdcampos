## 🚀 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/BfdCampos/monzo-mcp-bfdcampos.git
cd monzo-mcp-bfdcampos/monzo-mcp-bfdcampos
```

### Option A: Using uv (recommended)

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) first if you don’t have it:

```bash
# Install uv (macOS/Linux)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# Or with Homebrew: brew install uv
```

Then install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

### Option B: Using pip

On macOS with Homebrew Python, use a virtual environment first:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Or install the project in editable mode:
pip install -e .
```

## 🔑 API Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project directory with your Monzo credentials:

> [!NOTE]
> To get your credentials, follow the instructions in the [official Monzo Dev API Docs](https://docs.monzo.com/)

```
MONZO_ACCESS_TOKEN='your_access_token'
MONZO_USER_ID='your_user_id'
MONZO_ACCOUNT_ID='your_default_account_id'

# Add specific account IDs for different account types
MONZO_UK_PREPAID_PERSONAL_ACCOUNT_ID='your_prepaid_account_id'
MONZO_UK_RETAIL_PERSONAL_ACCOUNT_ID='your_personal_account_id'
MONZO_UK_MONZO_FLEX_PERSONAL_ACCOUNT_ID='your_flex_account_id'
MONZO_UK_REWARDS_PERSONAL_ACCOUNT_ID='your_rewards_account_id'
MONZO_UK_RETAIL_JOINT_JOINT_ACCOUNT_ID='your_joint_account_id'
```

> [!NOTE]
> I recommend getting the account IDs and adding them to your dotenv file to have a smoother experience with the server and reduce the number of API calls. This can also be found in the [official Monzo Dev API Docs](https://docs.monzo.com/).

## 🔧 Setup with Claude Desktop

### Method 1: Automatic Installation

Use the MCP CLI tool to install the server in the **Claude Desktop app** (not Cursor). From the project directory (the folder that contains `main.py`), after running `uv sync`:

```bash
cd monzo-mcp-bfdcampos   # from repo root; skip if you're already here
uv run mcp install main.py
uv run python fix_claude_mcp_config.py   # required: mcp install omits requests/python-dotenv
```

You should see: `Successfully installed Monzo in Claude app`, then `Updated Claude config...`. **Restart Claude Desktop** after that.

- **Why the extra step?** `mcp install` writes a config with only `--with mcp[cli]`, so the server crashes with "Server disconnected" (missing `requests`). The fix script patches the config to add `requests`, `python-dotenv`, and `--env-file`.
- **Wrong directory?** Run from the directory that contains `main.py`. If you're at the repo root: `uv run mcp install monzo-mcp-bfdcampos/main.py`, then `cd monzo-mcp-bfdcampos && uv run python fix_claude_mcp_config.py`.
- **Using Cursor?** `mcp install` only configures the Claude Desktop app. For Cursor, use **Settings → MCP** and set the args as in Method 2 (include `mcp[cli],requests,python-dotenv` and `--env-file`).

### Method 2: Manual Configuration

Add the server to your Claude Desktop configuration file located at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Monzo": {
      "command": "/Users/[Your Home Directory]/.local/bin/uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "mcp[cli],requests,python-dotenv",
        "--env-file",
        "/path/to/your/monzo-mcp-bfdcampos/monzo-mcp-bfdcampos/.env",
        "mcp",
        "run",
        "/path/to/your/monzo-mcp-bfdcampos/monzo-mcp-bfdcampos/main.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** Replace both `/path/to/your/` with your actual paths (same folder as `main.py` for the script and `.env`).
> **Important:** The `--with` argument must list **all** dependencies: `mcp[cli]`, `requests`, and `python-dotenv`. If any are missing, the server will crash with `ModuleNotFoundError` (see troubleshooting below). `--env-file` ensures your Monzo credentials are loaded.

## 🔌 Troubleshooting: "MCP Monzo: Server disconnected"

If Claude or Cursor shows **Server disconnected** for Monzo, the MCP process is exiting or crashing. Try the following:

1. **Check credentials**
   - Ensure you have a `.env` file in the **same directory as `main.py`** with at least:
     - `MONZO_ACCESS_TOKEN`
     - `MONZO_USER_ID`
     - `MONZO_ACCOUNT_ID` (or the specific account IDs you use)
   - If the token has expired, generate a new one in the [Monzo developer portal](https://developers.monzo.com/).

2. **Use `--env-file` in manual config**
   - If you configured the server manually (Method 2), add the `--env-file` argument (as in the JSON above) so the path to your `.env` is explicit. Without it, the app may start the server with a different working directory and not find `.env`.

3. **Run the server yourself to see errors**
   - From the project directory (the folder containing `main.py`):
     ```bash
     uv run mcp run main.py
     ```
   - You should see: `Monzo MCP server ready (waiting for client on stdin). Ctrl+C to stop.` Then the process will appear to **hang**—that’s expected. The server talks over stdin/stdout and is waiting for Claude/Cursor to connect. If it exits immediately with `MONZO_ACCESS_TOKEN is not set` or a Monzo API error, fix your `.env` or token and try again.

4. **Verify paths in MCP config**
   - The path to `main.py` in your config must be **absolute** and point to the real file (e.g. `/Users/you/projects/monzo-mcp-bfdcampos/monzo-mcp-bfdcampos/main.py`). The `uv` (or `python`) command must be the one that has the project’s dependencies installed.

5. **`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'`**
   - The app is running the server with only `--with mcp[cli]`, so the other dependencies aren’t installed. Edit your MCP server config (Claude Desktop config file or **Cursor → Settings → MCP**) and change the `--with` value to include **all** dependencies: `mcp[cli],requests,python-dotenv`. The args should look like:
     ```json
     "args": [
       "run",
       "--with",
       "mcp[cli],requests,python-dotenv",
       "--env-file",
       "/full/path/to/monzo-mcp-bfdcampos/monzo-mcp-bfdcampos/.env",
       "mcp",
       "run",
       "/full/path/to/monzo-mcp-bfdcampos/monzo-mcp-bfdcampos/main.py"
     ]
     ```
   - If you used `uv run mcp install main.py`, it may have written only `mcp[cli]`; add `,requests,python-dotenv` to that `--with` entry.

6. **Cursor**
   - In Cursor, MCP servers are configured in **Settings → MCP**. Use the same `command` and `args` as in the manual config above (including `--with mcp[cli],requests,python-dotenv`, `--env-file`, and the full path to `main.py`).

## 🤖 Using with Claude Desktop

2. Open the app and start a new conversation.
3. You can now ask Claude about your Monzo accounts:
   - "What's my current balance?"
   - "How much money do I have in my joint account?"
   - "Show me all my Monzo accounts"
   - "Move £50 from my personal account to my Savings pot"

## ❓ FAQ

<details><summary>My Claude Desktop is not detecting the server</summary>

- Ensure you have the latest version of Claude Desktop.
- Restart Claude Desktop by force quitting the app and reopening it.
- Make sure your path is correct in the configuration file.
- Use the absolute path to your `uv` installation, e.g., `/Users/[Your Home Directory]/.local/bin/uv` in the command section of the configuration file.
- Verify that the `requests` library is included in the `--with` argument list in your configuration, as this is a common cause of connection issues.

</details>

<details><summary>I've asked Claude about my balance but it's not using the MCP server</summary>

- LLMs like Claude may not always use the MCP server for every request. Try rephrasing your question, specifically asking Claude to check your Monzo balance using the Monzo MCP tool.
- You can check if there were any errors by looking at the logs in `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-Monzo.log`.

</details>

<details><summary>How do pot deposits and withdrawals work?</summary>

- When you deposit money into a pot or withdraw from a pot, the MCP creates a unique dedupe_id that includes the "triggered_by" parameter.
- This helps identify transactions and prevents accidental duplicate transactions.
- The default "triggered_by" value is "mcp", but you can customise this to track different sources of pot transfers.

</details>

<details><summary>What is uv?</summary>

- `uv` is a Python package manager and installer that's designed to be much faster than pip.
- It maintains isolated environments for your projects and resolves dependencies efficiently.
- Learn more at [github.com/astral-sh/uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).
